        <h3>Historical Background</h3>
        <p> On February 9th 2006 fifty-six representatives of nearly 50 Cairo-based non-governmental organizations (NGOs), community development groups and charity institutions met at the Townhouse Gallery of Contemporary Art to discuss the formation of an Egyptian/ Refugee Multicultural Council. This original planning meeting was co-chaired by Allan Leas and Ilse Griek, two representatives of the Dutch Council for Refugees which continue to aid and provide consultancies to the Council. An appointed Steering Committee has since then drawn up a mandate, overseen the development of an office, the hiring of staff and continues to meet and network regularly to fulfill and further the Council’s mission and objectives. </p><br>
        <p><strong>Tadamon</strong> sensitizes host communities on refugee issues, in particular local leaders, business people and civil society organizations. According to the previous micro-grants programs, lots of CBOs benefited from Micro-grants projects and they were able to successfully run their projects, with the result that thousands of refugees have been receiving significant assistance and have learned valuable skills. The refugee communities in Ard El Lewa, Maadi, Nasser City, Haram-Faysal and 6th of October City, have also benefited from the establishment of community centers in their areas.  Not only these centers are venues for a diverse range of organized activities, but they are also hubs of information and socialization for the refugee communities, increasing social network protection and trust especially for refugees' children, young people and women. The centers are acting as main connection points for the local refugee population and Egyptian community, the centers were in many cases able to respond quickly to the needs of community members and provide specific services previously unavailable in their neighborhoods.</p><br>

            2. Cooperate with initiatives aiming to raise awareness and knowledge of the cultures and backgrounds of the different refugee and asylum seeker groups living in Egypt. <br><br>
            3. Facilitate capacity building for members where necessary and provide training and advice through and to its members, by sharing experiences, information and skills.  <br><br>
            4. Facilitate needs assessment studies and research where possible. <br><br>
            5. Provide a general mechanism for the exchange of ideas, information and strategies in the field through meetings, electronic communications and other events- for all or some members to develop joint projects and undertake cooperative action. <br><br>

         <h2>Community Development National Occupational Standards and practices:</h2><br>
         <p>The concept that Tadamon Council addressed through 23 years of experience’s: <br><br>
            Community development enables people (focus on youth, women and children) to work collectively to bring about positive socioeconomic change. 
         </p><br>
         <p>This long-term process starts from people’s own experience and enables communities to work together to: </p><br>
         <p>● Identify their own needs and actions. <br> 
            ● Take collective action using their strengths and resources. <br>
            ● Develop their confidence, skills and knowledge. <br>
            ● Challenge unequal power relationships. <br>
            ● Promote social justice, equality and inclusion in order to improve the quality of their own lives, the communities in which they live and societies of which they are a part. <br>

        <h3>The Goal of Tadoman Council Work</h3>

        <h2>Tadaman Council contributes to Durable Solutions</h2><br>
        <p>Durable solutions are achieved when disagreements are no longer solved through violence, basic human rights  and refugees  are respected, governance is settled and broadly accountable, and communities are relatively self- reliant. Durable solutions are the building blocks for peace and stability and for economic, social and political development. Programs that lay foundations for durable solutions address structural problems more than traditional relief solutions do, helping people to change their societies rather than merely fulfill their immediate needs. Tadoman cannot and should not impose solutions; instead, we want to empower people to define, clarify and bring life to their own answers. Without this kind of ownership, Tadoman programs may leave people vulnerable to renewed cycles of violence, human rights abuse and forced refugees. Working toward durable solutions is a long-term process. The society’s centers with which Tadamon works typically suffer decades of conflict. Their attainment of durable solutions may take generations. We want all Tadamon council activities to work toward this goal. Tadamon aspires to accompany societies as they find and pursue durable solutions. At that point, we at Tadamon  would be able to say that our role has ended. The Program Framework provides us with a roadmap for this journey.</p><br>
        <h2>Tadamon Council Aims:</h2><br>
        <p>Saving Lives (Converting people) Lives from victim to active citizen and working for healthy future, Strengthening Institutions and Promoting Social Cohesion. <br>How does Tadamon best work with armed conflict /war-affected communities and societies to find and pursue durable solutions? <br>Where do we concentrate our commitment, refugees/migrants, and resources? <br>The Program Framework answers these questions with its three key aims. <br>Tadamon pursues durable solutions by protecting rights, Strengthening Institutions, and Promoting Social Cohesion.</p><br>
        <p><strong>Saving Lives:</strong> Tadamon works with refugee’s societies, others affected by conflict to sustain their survival with dignity and safety. Perhaps most obvious in a crisis situation, saving lives refers not only to preventing mortality, but also to ensuring people’s basic rights—that individuals are recognized by law and have access to services such as nutrition, protection, capacity building and economic development in all situations.  Helping people survive with dignity is the first step to durable solutions. But conflict can recur unless its root causes are addressed. Aware that conflict has many causes; Tadamon believes that communities can do a great deal to reduce inequities that are at the core of the problem.</p><br>
        <p><strong>Strengthening Institutions</strong>: Institutions are defined as organizations, groups and associations. They structure interaction in areas of interest—in government, law, public service, civil society and commerce—and can be related to both causes and consequences of conflict. Transparent, inclusive, accountable and participatory institutions (those that involve citizens in decision making) are the foundation for a well-functioning society where people manage their differences without resorting to violence. Therefore, the second aim of Tadamon council programs is to support war-affected societies strengthen institutions. But society’s institutions do not exist in a vacuum. They cannot function properly without the trust of the citizens they serve.</p><br>
        <p><strong>Promoting and enhancing Social Cohesion.</strong> War-affected societies cannot move away from conflict if trust does not exist among the people themselves. Social cohesion refers to common bonds that promote tolerance, pluralism and inclusion. It is the trust between different people and between citizens and their institutions that makes for good governance. Social cohesion is one of the first things damaged by conflict. It is also one of the most difficult to repair. Nevertheless, it is a vital building block for war-affected communities working toward sustainable peace and development. </p><br>
        <p><strong>Tadoman’s METHODOLOGY:</strong> The Program Framework reaffirms the value of Tadaman Council a’s multi-sector approach, as it provides the rationale for addressing refugee/migrants in Egypt needs holistically and offers programs. These programs consist principles.</p><br>
        <h2>The Programs is divided into three categories: </h2><br>
        <p><strong>• Basic Services Programs: </strong><br><br>
            Seek to improve refugees/migrant’s quality of life and the conditions in which they live, as well as enhance the dignity by which they do so. Examples include education, social, livelihood activity inside community centers, health and support by community schools. <br><br>
             <strong>• Economic Development Programs: </strong><br><br>
              Seek to give refugees/migrants access the resources they need to improve their standard of life, livelihood and sense of well-being at present and for the future. Examples include microgrants activities, saving activities and vocational training. <br><br>
            <strong>• Protection, Peace Building & Governance Programs:</strong> <br><br>
             Seek to empower people to engage and interact with decision makers, to make collective decisions about their futures, and to claim their basic rights as recognized by international and national law, as well as help governing bodies become more inclusive. Examples include war affect population protection, civil society and community development, provision of alleviation of gender-based violence, and support of rule of law and good governance. <br><br>
            </p> <br>
            <h2> Cross Cutting Interventions:</h2><br>
            <p>• disability. <br>
                • Gender. <br>
                • HIV/AIDS. <br>
                • Environment. <br>
             </p><br>
             <p><strong>Tadamon’s council programming principles:</strong> Five programming principles guide Tadamon’s council work in all settings and across all program areas. The principles are crucial complements to the program sectors because, in many ways, how we work is as important as what we accomplish. Consequently, the methods we use must be participatory, based on real partnership, and reflective of refugee’s rights and the contexts in which they live. All activities will consider Do No Harm and Accountability to Affected Population principles and Conflict Issues Tadamon’s council programming principles include:</p><br>
             <p>• Protecting and Promoting Rights;. <br>
                • Participation. <br>
                • Capacity Building. <br>
                • Partnership. <br>
                • Holistic / Integrated Programming.
